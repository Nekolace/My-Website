#Nick's Rootin' Tootin' Website

My website that I put together as a sort of showcase for previous projects I have completed. I wanted to publish it to github to let anyone interested take a sneak-peak behind the curtain and see how I did it.

It's certainly not perfect, but it does work and, in my opinion, it's pretty cool.

I hope you agree!
